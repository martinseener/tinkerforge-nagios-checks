# (c) 2013 - Martin Seener (martin@seener.de)

# This Nagios check will connect to your tinkerforge distance-ir-bricklet, read the measured distance
# and alert you when the distance is more or less than a given distance using a threshold.
# The threshold can be calculated using tf_distance_ir_bricklet_stddev_calc.sh script. For that built up
# your bricklet with the distance you want to measure and run that script for one or two hours (3600 or 7200)
# measurements. It will calculate the standard deviation for you which then can be used as the threshold.

# This check can be used for example for a distance check, if a door in a server rack was opened, therefore
# the distance between the bricklet and the door has de- or increased.
